BEWARE OF MISLEADING STATISTICS
This pitfall has already been discussed in "Measure and Act," but it's a big one. Making decisions based on metrics is a good idea, but small businesses tend to have relatively small numbers that they are working with. As such, your metrics are easily polluted by noise and random variations. One new click fraud ring, or the disappearance of a referrer spammer, can be enough to move your web metrics significantly. Your sales revenue probably sees more variation each month due to chance or seasonal effects than from anything you've done– especially if you are in a business with long sales cycles.
It is therefore important to look not only at short-term, but long-term metrics related to your business. How does this entire quarter's sales look like compared to the same quarter last year? Are there disturbing trends in my web metrics if I look back a full year? The more data you can aggregate together, the less susceptible it will be to outliers when you're analyzing it.
